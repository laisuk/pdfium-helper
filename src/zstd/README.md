# Internal Zstandard decoder

Vendored pure Rust decoder adapted from ruzstd 0.9.0, based on the OpenCC
decoder adaptation, for pdfium-helper's embedded Pdfium native libraries.
Compiled only with `pdfium-embed`; the decoder requires Rust 1.75 and has no
external decoding dependencies. Pdfium itself remains a native library.
See [LICENSE-RUZSTD](LICENSE-RUZSTD) and [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for attribution.

## Entry point and retained dependencies

- `decompress()`: initializes one Zstandard frame, uses a bounded frame content
  size (FCS) only as an output-capacity hint, calls
  `decode_blocks(UptoBytes(...))`, and drains eligible decoded bytes directly
  into the final output vector with `collect_into()`.
- Frames without an FCS remain fully supported. An absent, oversized, or
  otherwise unusable FCS does not prevent decoding; the output vector grows as
  needed.

Decoding requires frame/block parsing, literal and sequence decoding, FSE and
Huffman tables, bit readers, scratch state, and the ring buffer. Collection
retains the history window required for backreferences until the frame finishes,
then drains the remaining output. Repeated entropy tables within a frame remain
supported.

## Preserved behavior

The decoder processes one frame and ignores trailing input. A leading skippable
frame is an error.

Checksum bytes are consumed, and truncated checksums are errors. Checksums are
not validated; the upstream hash feature was never enabled by this crate.
The decoder keeps its 100 MiB window limit and format-level window validation.

Pdfium native binaries are payloads, not Zstandard decoding dictionaries.
No Zstandard decoding dictionary is supplied, so nonzero dictionary IDs return
`DictNotProvided`. Invalid history offsets retain their decoding errors,
including `NotEnoughBytesInDictionary` with zero available bytes where
applicable.

## Frame content size

The committed `.zst` binaries are regenerated using `compress-pdfium.ps1` at
the repository root, which requires `zstd.exe` in `PATH`. Cargo embeds the
existing artifacts without running a compressor. These artifacts are generated
with one-shot Zstandard compression and declare an FCS. The decoder uses a
valid FCS of at most 64 MiB only to reserve output capacity; it is not trusted as a
decoding limit or required for compatibility with older streaming-generated
artifacts.

The embedded-artifact regression verifies that the committed Zstandard frame
has an FCS matching its actual decompressed Windows x64 Pdfium binary. Separate regressions
retain coverage for legacy frames without an FCS and for incorrect FCS values
being treated only as allocation hints.

## Trimming scope

Removed the dictionary parser/registration/table-copy APIs, general-purpose
frame getters and alternate output APIs, sized-output and `decode_all()` paths,
writer support and writer-only tests, inactive checksum hashing hooks, unused
ring-buffer alternatives, unreachable error variants, and the std I/O
compatibility module. The active decoding algorithms are retained.

The output path drains directly from the history buffer into the final vector,
avoiding the former temporary collection vector and its extra full-output copy.

Regression tests cover embedded data equality and FCS metadata, unknown and
incorrect content sizes, history across collection boundaries, frame/skip
boundaries, checksum consumption, truncation, dictionary IDs, and window
limits. Ring-buffer tests retain a test-only checked wrapper around the
production copy routine.
